Rupert Dawson
A 26 year old man with tritanopia color blindness (blue/green, red/purple) from Grand Rapids, Michigan who is interested in accessing kickstarter data mostly out of curiosity. He wishes to have a tool that allows him to sort through kickstarter data, identify trends among various categories, and aid him in potentially identifying a kickstarter that both interests him and shares qualities with other successful kickstarters. As an accountant, Rupert wishes to be able to better factor his analytical nature into his kickstarter exploration.
