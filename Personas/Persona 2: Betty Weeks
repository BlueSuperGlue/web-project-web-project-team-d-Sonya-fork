Betty Weeks
A 36 year old woman from Polk City, Florida.  She works in food preparation in a private establishment as a cook.  Her highest level of education is a high-school diploma and she’s married with children.  Betty doesn’t make a ton of money, and wants to make sure she’s a smart spender.  Because of this, she wants to make sure that the kickstarters she invests in are going to succeed.  In her spare time, she’s a “extreme beer advocate” and loves to travel.  She’s interested in investing in ways that exotic foreign beers can be brought more economically to her doorstep.  She also, perhaps contrarilly, enjoys looking for new ways to enjoy food in a healthier light.   She also supports two children at home.  She’s got an interest in supporting the next upcoming thing, and wants to ensure her investments on kickstarter aren’t going to go to waste.
