Lynda Johnson
A 31 year old woman from the Twin Cities, who currently works as stock-broker. She has a bachelors degree in Economics, and has a hobby making paper-mache sculptures. She sells some of the sculptures to help pay for the materials, but is interested in expanding a workshop in her home to enable her to have multiple in progress at once. She has backed kickstarters in the past, and noticed that there seemed to be some patterns in the success rate of them, but hasn’t had the time to analyze them herself. She want to be able to gauge how much she can reasonably ask for for her hobby, as well as how many backers she expects she’ll need.
